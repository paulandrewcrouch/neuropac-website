      <table aria-describedby="lawful-basis">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Purpose</th>
            <th scope="col">Data types</th>
            <th scope="col">Lawful basis</th>

            <td>Legal obligation; legitimate interests; establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <p>
        We may send marketing communications if you have opted in (or where permitted for B2B on legitimate interests).
        You can opt out at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:team@neuropac.co.uk">team@neuropac.co.uk</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing your data</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with trusted processors who provide services to us
        (e.g., hosting, email, accounting, payment processing, analytics) under appropriate contracts. We may also share
        data where required by law or to protect our rights or those of others.
      </p>

      <h2>International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Some processors may be located outside the UK/EEA. Where transfers occur, we rely on appropriate safeguards
        such as UK-approved Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or adequacy regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain general contact/engagement data for <strong>6 years</strong> after your last interaction unless a
        different period is required or permitted by law. Transaction and accounting records are retained for up to
        <strong>7 years</strong> to comply with tax and legal obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data. If a personal data breach
        occurs, we will notify the ICO without undue delay (and where feasible, within 72 hours). If the breach is likely
        to result in a high risk to you, we will also inform you without undue delay.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Under UK GDPR you have the right to: access your data; rectify inaccuracies; request erasure; restrict or object
        to processing; and data portability (in certain cases). You also have the right to withdraw consent where we rely
        on it. To exercise your rights, email <a href="mailto:team@neuropac.co.uk">team@neuropac.co.uk</a>. We will respond within one month.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to complain to the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO):
        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ico.org.uk</a>. We would appreciate the chance to
        address your concerns first.
      </p>
